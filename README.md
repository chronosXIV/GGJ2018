# GGJ2018
Game written in C# and made using Unity as an entry for the Global Game Jam 2018.

The weekend of 26th January, Global Game Jam 2018 took place all over the world and instead of one of the university held jams, I decided to go to the one hosted by Games For the Many at Newspeak House, Shoreditch. <br/>
This specific jam site was full of indie developers, which pretty much forced me to push my programming and game design abilities to the max. Me and my team managed to make a fully working 2D game in 48 hours. It was really fun meeting completely new people from various backgrounds and getting creative.

This game is a two player game where you 'transmit' pills to Donald Trump, which in turn, generate fake news about him.<br/>
Player 1 Controls: A = go left, D = go right, W = jump, E = grab<br/>
Player 2 Controls: left directional key = go left, right directional key = go right, up directional key = jump, L = grab

The executable file is currently only for Mac OS. In the future I will also put a Windows/Linux executable file.

PlayerControl.cs: Script written by me to control characters with specified buttons for each player. This specification is made in the Unity engine.<br/>
grabberscript.cs: Script written by me that allows the character to grab an object, in this case, the pills.
